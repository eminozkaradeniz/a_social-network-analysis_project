Prof. Zeynep A. KOÇER- INFLUENZA VIRUSES WITH PANDEMIC POTENTIAL (06.05.2021) Natural reservoir of influenza A viruses (IAVs) is wild aquatic birds, but they can infect a wide range of host species including poultry, swine, cats, dogs, horses, sea mammals and humans. IAVs generally circulate in aquatic birds as low pathogenic viruses. However, some strains may acquire mutations and become highly pathogenic in poultry that may also transmit to humans causing fatalities. On the other hand, low pathogenic IAVs of avian origin may donate their genes to IAVs circulating in swine and humans that may lead to the emergence of pandemic strains. So far, there have been four recorded influenza pandemics in humans. Our research focuses on the emergence of novel low pathogenic IAV strains of avian origin with pandemic potential that may readily be transmissible to mammals including humans. In addition, we focus on the risk assessment of other zoonotic viruses of avian and bat origin in terms of pandemic potential.

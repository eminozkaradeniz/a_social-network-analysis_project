2021-2022 Akademik Yıl The Testimonials Of Our Incoming Students I can say that İzmir and Dokuz Eylul University did exceed my expectations. The students and the teachers were all hospitable and really helpful. They did everything to make me feel at home. All in all I can say that this Erasmus period was a great experience and made me fall in love with İzmir. I’ll be definitely coming back to İzmir. For me as I am an Iranian coming from Germany, it was a great time. The culture, natüre and everything was great and I enjoyed it very much. The university infrastructure and flexibility for the lectures and quality of the lecturers were good and I reflected to my home University and Erasmus website. Thank you for everything one more time, coming to İzmir was one of the best decisions in life. Both of us will definitely recommend to everyone. I was so happy to be ın contact with all of you and I am very thankful. Hope to see you again and wish you all the best. I would like to thank you for being always helpful and assisting me with all of my diffıculties and questions. I would like you to know that if I had no further plans for this year I would extend my stay without any hesitation.

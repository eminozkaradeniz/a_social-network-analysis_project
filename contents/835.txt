Scholarships are awarded to successful and needy students of our university by the Higher Education Credit and Hostels Institution, natural and legal persons throughout their regular period of study so as to facilitate their social and cultural improvement. Türkiye Scholarship granted by Turkish Higher Education Board (Yükseköğretim Kurulu-YÖK) is a generous scholarship scheme aiming at providing education opportunity in Turkey to international students. As, Turkish Higher Education Board indicates that “Türkiye Scholarships is a scholarship program which not only provides financial support but also ensures university placement for students in their intended program of application. With this feature, it differs from other scholarship programs in the world. Apart from university education, it is aimed to provide students with the benefits of social, cultural and academic extra- curricular programs and activities while they are in Turkey” (Türkiye Scholarships, 2021).

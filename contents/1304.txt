Physiology Department. Our laboratory allows athletes from all branches to measure and improve performance with scientifically proven methods. Through the exercise tests applied in our laboratory, individual performances of the athletes can be measured, monitored and compared with other athletes during the season. Furthermore, the motor capability that is desired to be improved by determining the training loads can be improved in the most efficient state. The following measurements can be made in our laboratories. Determination of body composition Pulmonary function test Basal metabolic rate Aerobic power (Cardiopulmonary exercise test) Anaerobic threshold determination Wingate Anaerobic Power Test Bounce tests (static, static by weight, countermovement, depth) Speed ​​tests (with an intermediate degree between 0-100 m) Reaction test Agility tests (ajax shuttle, Illinois agility, 505 agility, t-test) Fire rate test Anaerobic capacity (running-based anaerobic sprint test) Biochemical analyzes (GGT, Bilirubin, GOT, Creatinine, GPT, K, Hemoglobin, Urea, Cholesterol, Uric Acid, CK, Pancreatic Amylase, Glucose, Amylase, HDL Cholesterol, Alkaline Phosphatase, Triglyceride) Our equipment Health group Yasen ECG 903 A 12-channel electrocardiography Spirobank Spirometer MD 300 Pulse Oximeter Kenz Pedometer-Pedometer Body composition group Skinfold Caliper Skinfold Thickness Gauge G-Tech International Height-Weight Meter Tanita UM 073 Body Fat Percentage Meter Langen Messstab 5003 Ultrasonic Height Meter InBody 720 Body Composition Analyzer Mezuro Stick ergometers Cosmed T150 Treadmill Monark 839 E Bicycle Ergometer Monark 824 E Bicycle Ergometer Monark 819 E Bicycle Ergometer Monark 894 E Peak Bike Bicycle Ergometer dynamometers Takei Physical Fitness Hand-Claw Dynamometer Takei Physical FitnessBack-Leg Dynamometer Takei Physical Fitness Jumpmeter Polar watches Polar RS 400 Heart Rate Monitor Polar RS 800 Heart Rate Monitor Polar S1 accelerometer Compatible with Fitmate Pro Wingate peak power ergometer compatible with chest band Polar Fitwatch Polar Xtrainer analyzers Biocene C_Line Lactate Analyzer YSI 1500 Sport Lactate Analyzer Fitmate Pro O2 Analyzer Reflotron Plus Biochemical Analyzer Biopac MP100 Metabolic Analyzer Measuring Aids Q&Q Stopwatch Protech Stopwatch Thermometer-hygrometer-barometer Sit-out stretch table Leica Disto D3 Laser Meter @DEU Dokuz Eylül Üniversitesi Necat Hepkon Spor Bilimleri Fakültesi
